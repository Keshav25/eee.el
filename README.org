* eee.el: Extended Emacs With External Tui application

eee.el launches excellent terminal user interface tools (such as yazi, fzf, lazy-git, etc.) with Emacs asynchronously. It is very fast and does not burden Emacs.

ee.el Support:
1. [[https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/][yazi]] : launch yazi from Emacs asynchronously, then yazi tell emacs which file to open
2. [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/][ripgrep]] : launch ripgrep + fzf from Emacs asynchronous, then ripgrep tell emacs jump to which file and position
3. [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/][fzf]] : combined with ripgrep
4. [[https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit][lazygit]] : launch lazygit from Emacs asynchronously
5. more tui tools and options will be enhanced and provided.
